# Lab 1 (Due 04/13/2016)
Write C/C++ code to compute
  1. nth Fibonacci number
  2. Factorial of n (given n is integral)

  The table for Fib and Fac is given in the course material page.

  3. Calculate the number of times Collatz function is called for n, before n=1 Collatz function is defined in the notes as C(n) = n/2 for n even, and 3n+1 when n is odd. For every n (by the Collatz conjecture), C(n) approaches 1 eventually.

  Please test your code on some numbers to make sure there are no trivial bugs.

 ## Usage

 ```
 make all
 make run
 ```
