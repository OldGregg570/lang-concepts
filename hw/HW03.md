## 1. What are the major difference between Lisp family of languages and Common Lisp (1 pt).

### Lisp

Lisp is a family of programming languages. Emacs, Scheme, AutoLISP, Clojure, and others are all what are known as *dialects* of Lisp.

### Common Lisp
Common Lisp is a dialect of lisp. It is a general-purpose multi-paradigm language. AutoLISP and Emacs are extension languages which are integrated into other software.

The relationship between the two is "subset"; Common Lisp is Lisp, but Lisp is not necessarily Common Lisp.


## 2. Write Common Lisp code for the following:

### a. [example]
```
gcl -load ./src/factorial.lsp
```

### b. Fibonacci number: Write Common Lisp program to print the first n fibonacci numbers (1 pt)
```
gcl -load ./src/fibonacci.lsp
```

### c. Fibonacci Encoder: Write Common Lisp program to encode student id, square, and cube of id (3 pt)
```
gcl -load ./src/fibonacci-encode.lsp
```


## 4. Write a Common Lisp program to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. Here is an example, where B is the computer.
```
gcl -load ./src/tic-tac-toe.lsp
```
