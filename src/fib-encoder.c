/**
 * 1. In C/C++ write a Fibonacci Encoder, which converts a given number
 *    into a sequence of Fibonacci numbersâ€™s index [Hint: consider the examples
 *    given below]
 *
 *  Example 1:
 *    Fib enc of 1987 is 1597 (@ 17) (remaining) 390
 *    Fib enc of 390 is 377 (@ 14) (remaining) 13
 *    Fib enc of 13 is 13 (@ 7) (remaining) 0
 *    Fib enc of 1987 = [17,14,7]
 *
 *  Example 2:
 *    Fib enc of 6543 is 4181 (@ 19) (remaining) 2362
 *    Fib enc of 2362 is 1597 (@ 17) (remaining) 765
 *    Fib enc of 765 is 610 (@ 15) (remaining) 155
 *    Fib enc of 155 is 144 (@ 12) (remaining) 11
 *    Fib enc of 11 is 8 (@ 6) (remaining) 3
 *    Fib enc of 3 is 3 (@ 4) (remaining) 0
 *    Fib enc of 6543 = [19,17,15,12,6,4]
 *
 *    Submit your code as well as output of encoding for your student number,
 *    the square of your student number and the cube of your student number.
 *    Please include the output of your code verbatim in the PRINT OUT.
